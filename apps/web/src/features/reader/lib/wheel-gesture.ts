/**
 * Turns a continuous wheel/trackpad delta stream into discrete, once-per-gesture
 * triggers. A trackpad swipe is not one event but a burst: the drag itself, then
 * a long momentum tail of decaying deltas. Acting on every event would cascade a
 * single flick into many page turns / navigator steps.
 *
 * The delta stream alone cannot say whether fingers are still on the pad — the
 * one bit that separates "this swipe still coasting" from "a new swipe". So the
 * machine runs in one of two modes:
 *
 * PHASE MODE — active once the host shell reports real gesture phases (the
 * macOS NSEvent monitor, delivered via `platform/wheel-phase.ts`). With ground
 * truth the rules are exact, and timing heuristics play no part while a swipe
 * is coasting:
 * - a new touch starts a new gesture; accumulated travel fires once at the
 *   threshold and the gesture stays latched until the next touch;
 * - momentum may still complete a light swipe that hadn't reached the
 *   threshold, but can never fire a second time — so webview jank that stalls
 *   and clumps the momentum tail cannot fabricate page turns;
 * - a phase-less stream (mouse-wheel notches; trackpads always announce a
 *   touch first) ratchets: every `threshold` of travel steps once.
 *
 * HEURISTIC MODE — everywhere no phase source exists (Windows/Linux trackpads,
 * plain-browser dev), the pre-phase behavior is kept unchanged: accumulate,
 * fire at the threshold, stay latched until the gesture ends. A gesture ends
 * when the stream goes quiet (`quietMs` without an event). Two cues end it
 * early, because a user re-swiping mid-momentum never pauses:
 * - a direction reversal — momentum never flips sign, so an opposite delta is
 *   deliberate input;
 * - a decay-then-rise: momentum decays monotonically (touching the trackpad
 *   cancels it outright), while a fresh drag ramps up from small deltas. Once
 *   the magnitude has fallen well below the gesture's peak ("armed"), two
 *   consecutive meaningful rises read as a new swipe. A steady continuous
 *   scroll never dips, never arms, and so still fires only once.
 * These are guesses reconstructed from timing and magnitudes, and uneven event
 * delivery can defeat them — which is exactly why platforms that can surface
 * the real phases use phase mode instead.
 *
 * Purely timestamp-driven (no timers): feed each event's delta with a time
 * reading and act on the returned direction. All feeds into one instance MUST
 * share a single monotonic clock. Raw `event.timeStamp` is NOT such a clock
 * when events come from more than one document — each document stamps against
 * its own time origin (a section iframe starts near zero), and an origin jump
 * mid-gesture reads as a quiet gap, unlatching against leftover momentum.
 * See `wheelEventTime` in FoliateReaderView for the normalization.
